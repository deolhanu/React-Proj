Fisrt step is to create a JSON server. We can do it by creating a JSON file and and adding the script in the server which is ""server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000"".
JSON file is by name of db.json

Second we ran the server using CMD by command npm run server.

Next step is to fetch the data from the server url and then implement the search function.
Logic for that is in App.js
